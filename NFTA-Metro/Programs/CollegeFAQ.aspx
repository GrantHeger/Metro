     <p align="center"><strong>Question & Answer </strong></p>
       
       <ul id="icon">
            <li><strong>What is the College/University Unlimited Access Pass Program? </strong><br />
            The College/University Pass Program allows students of participating colleges unlimited access to the Metro Bus and Rail system, seven days a week during the school year.  There are no additional fares or transfer fees.  For school, work, shopping, errands, eating out or just going out.  Metro has an easy, economical and environmentally friendly way to get you where you want to go.  Please note that student transit passes are not valid for Metro special services. </li>
        
            <li><strong>How does the program work?</strong><br />
            Each new school year NFTA-Metro provides participating schools with Metro transit passes for their students.  On the back of each pass is a magnetic stripe that codes the pass as valid.  The front of the card is customized to include the name and/or logo for your college, student photo, ID number and pass expiration date.</li>
        
            <li><strong>How do I use my pass? </strong><br />
            When using Metro Bus, simply board any Metro Bus and swipe your Metro transit pass in the fare box.  You do not need to swipe your  pass when riding Metro Rail, however you must have it in your possession.  If you are riding Metro Rail and do not have your pass when asked by Metro personnel, you could be charged with fare evasion which carries a stiff penalty.  In addition, students must always have supporting picture identification in addition to their Metro Transit Pass. </li>
        
            <li><strong>Can someone else use my pass if I am not using it?</strong><br />
            No, your Metro pass is only for your use.   The pass is non-transferable.  If your pass is found to be used fraudulently, it will be revoked by the operator, reported to the college and further privileges may be lost.</li>
        
            <li><strong>What if I lose my pass or it becomes damaged?</strong><br />
            If you lose your transit pass,  or if it is damaged or cracked, you should report it to the appropriate office at your college immediately. The pass will then be invalidated in the system. 
A replacement pass may be purchased for a fee. This fee must be paid with a check or money order.  
</li>
        
            <li><strong>Is there help to get me where I need to go?</strong><br />
            Yes, NFTA-Metro provides an online Trip Planner at nfta.com.  You type in your starting location and destination, and the appropriate routes will be provided.  All routes and schedules can be found online.  However, should you have further questions, contact the Customer Care Center Monday through Friday from 6:00 a.m. – 6:00 p.m. at (716) 855-7211.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Is my pass valid for Paratransit services? </strong><br />
            Yes, you must contact our <a href="/Paratransit/">Special Services</a> office if you are disabled to confirm eligibility and request an application at 716.855.7377   or  TTY/ Relay 711 or 800.622.1220.</li>
        
            <li><strong>What is the Metro Xtras card? </strong><br />
            In addition to providing an added transportation benefit to students of participating colleges, each student is eligible for value-added discounts from vendors listed <a href="/Programs/Xtras.aspx">here</a>.   Just show your valid Metro transit student pass at any of these vendors and take advantage of the savings. </li>
