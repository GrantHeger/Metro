    <asp:PlaceHolder runat="server" ID="phTemp">
    	        	    <strong>What is an Emergency Ride?</strong>
 
                <p>The Emergency Ride Home Program is a “safety net” in emergency situations for those Metro bus or rail riders that purchase monthly public transportation passes.  Emergency Ride assistance may be used in the event of an unexpected personal/family emergency or illness where public transportation will not be available at your stop for 45 minutes or more.  Please note that   missing your bus/rail ride or inclement weather are not considered emergencies. The Program is available to customers with valid calendar month passes or 30-day passes and who have properly pre-registered for the program.</p>
                
                <h3>Here's How It Works</h3>
                
                <p>An emergency ride can be used to take you, the pass holder, to your car or to one emergency related destination provided that the next bus or rail car will not be arriving at your stop for 45 minutes or more.  This service is only available in Metro's fixed route service area.</li><li>
As a Metro monthly or 30-day pass holder, and as long as you are pre-registered, you can arrange for an Emergency Ride by calling the hot line at 716-855-7405 any time between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. Emergency rides must be arranged prior to 5 p.m.  In order to arrange for your emergency transportation, a Metro customer care staff representative will need the following information:</li><li>
Your valid Metro Pass serial number (located underneath the date and month of the pass); </li><li>
Your name, address and telephone number where you can be reached for confirmation of ride arrangements;</li><li>
Detailed information on your pick-up and drop-off locations; and</li><li>
If you are a Metro Advantage participant, verification of your place of employment.</li><li>
When your transportation arrives, just present the driver with your valid Metro Pass (and photo identification if asked), and sign the voucher he or she will give you. There is no charge to you for the ride.
</p>

                
                <p>You must be pre-registered to take advantage of the Emergency Ride Program.</p>
                
                <h4>Pre-Registration</h4>
                
                <p>To be eligible for Emergency Ride service, customers MUST be pre-registered in the Program.  Please call customer care at (716) 855-7211 or send an email to: info@nfta.com and provide the following information:</p>

            <strong>What is an Emergency Ride?</strong>
