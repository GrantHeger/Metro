    	<p>With Metro Perk employers can offer employees a pre-tax benefit for transit use.  Employers using Metro Perk reduce payroll taxes.  Employees reduce their taxable income, saving approximately 30%.  It is easy to set up and even easier to use.</p>

        <p><img src="/img/perk-cutout.jpg" width="280" height="246" alt="Metro Perk" align="left" vspace="10px" /><br /><b>For employees</b> – A $75 monthly pass as a real cost of $53 for people in a 15% tax bracket.  People in a higher tax bracket could save even more.  The full $75 is taken out of a paycheck, but before taxes.  By avoiding tax on that money, most Metro riders will save about 30%.</p>
        
        <p><b>For employers</b> – Every $1,000 reduction in payroll saves $76 in FICA, annually.  (Savings dependent on payroll tax rates and wage base.) Social Security and other savings may also apply.</p>
