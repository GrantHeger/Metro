        <p>Curb to curb, lift equipped van service called Paratransit Access Line (PAL) is available for qualifying individuals. PAL's service area extends three-quarters of a mile on either side of or from the end of Metro's bus and rail fixed route service. This does not apply to commuter or express route service.</p>
        
        <p>PAL is a shared ride service and direct trips to and from your destination are not guaranteed.  A trip on PAL will be comparable to the duration of an identical trip taken on the fixed route service.  Comparable includes all factors such as, travel time to the bus stop and/or rail station, waiting time, actual riding time, transfers and travel from the stop to the ultimate destination.  This standard exists except when circumstances are beyond the NFTA’s control (including inclement weather, as well as any factors constituting traffic delays).</p>
        
        <p>The NFTA makes provisions to ensure that each passenger actually gets from his/her point of origin to his/her point of destination.  To meet this origin to destination requirement, service may need to be provided to some individuals or at some locations in a way that goes beyond curb-to-curb service.</p>
        
        <p>To qualify for PAL you must be unable to board, ride or disembark from a Metro Bus or Rail vehicle, or travel to and from a bus stop.</p>
        <p>Before using PAL you must fill out an application which is certified by a qualifying healthcare professional (listed on the application) and submit it to the PAL office.</p>
        <p>Trips are made on a reservation basis.</p>
        <p>Trips may be scheduled up to 14 days in advance or one day prior to the trip.</p>
        <p>Riders with temporary disabilities may be eligible for PAL.</p>
        <p>Fares are double the fixed route fare. Please have exact fare.  Operators do not make change.</p>
        <p>Sanctions may be placed on PAL riders who have a pattern or practice of late cancellations or no-show trips.</p>
          
        <p><strong>NFTA&rsquo;s PAL Pass</strong></p>
        <p>Traveling with Paratransit is now even more convenient for individuals with disabilities.&nbsp; PAL clients and interested agencies can now purchase a fixed amount of rides with the same discounts offered to regular Metro Pass holders.&nbsp; The pass is simply hole punched by a Paratransit Operator each time the client boards the van.&nbsp; The card can be discarded once all the numbers are punched.</p>
