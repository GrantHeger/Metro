      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>What Is The Reduced-Fare Program?<br />
        </strong>The Federal Government requires that a reduced fare policy be in effect for senior citizens and people with disabilities during our off-peak hours. Off-peak hours are 9AM to 3PM and after 6PM on weekdays and all day on weekends and holidays. The NFTA has expanded the half fare program to be in effect throughout the day. </p>
        <p><strong>Who Qualifies for Reduced Fare?<br />
        </strong>You must be at least 65 years old or have a disability to receive the NFTA-Metro Reduced-Fare card. The fee for the card is $2. The Reduced-Fare card may be used on any NFTA regular route service. It is not valid on PAL service. </p>
        
        <p><strong>How To Obtain A Card If You Are 65 Or Older<br />
        </strong>Individuals 65 years or older may apply for a NFTA Metro Reduced-Fare card or they may obtain a Senior complimentary card through Erie or Niagara Counties.  Erie County cards are obtained at the Rath Building, Room 1329 on Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. until noon and from 1:00-3:00 p.m.  Niagara County cards are obtained by calling the Council on the Aging at 285-8224, Extension 215.   Individuals 65 years or older must provide proof of age, such as your birth certificate, driver's license, or other official document.</p>
        
        <p>Note:&nbsp; When you go to get your card, take proof of your age, such as your birth certificate, driver's license, or other official document.<br />
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>How To Obtain A Card If You Are Disabled<br />
        </strong>The Federal Transit Administration defines &ldquo;persons with disabilities&rdquo; for purposes of the Reduced-Fare program. Metro&rsquo;s Reduced-Fare Program for Persons with Disabilities provides reduced-fare transportation for persons with the following disabilities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>receiving Medicare benefits for any reason </li>
          <li>serious mental illness (SMI) and receiving&nbsp;Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits</li>
          <li>blindness</li>
          <li>hearing impairment</li>
          <li>ambulatory disability</li>
          <li>loss of both hands</li>
          <li>intellectual disability and/or other organic mental capacity impairment </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="style4">If you do not have one of these disabilities, you are not eligible for the Reduced-Fare  Program. </p>
        <p>To be considered for the NFTA&rsquo;s Reduced-Fare Program, you must fill out the <a href="/pdfs/application-reduced.pdf" target="_app">Reduced-Fare Application</a> and submit the application in its entirety to:</p>

          <strong><br />
        </strong>When you get on the bus, swipe your Reduced-Fare card, and using exact change, put half the regular fare into the fare box. When you are using the rail, you must have your reduced fare card readily available to NFTA personnel upon request.</p>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: Medicare Card<br />
        </strong>You do not need the NFTA reduced fare card if you have a Medicare card. You may use your Medicare card in lieu of a NFTA reduced fare card on any regularly scheduled NFTA bus. When you get on the bus, show your card to the bus operator, and using exact change, put half the regular fare into the farebox. You will also need to show a photo ID.</p>
