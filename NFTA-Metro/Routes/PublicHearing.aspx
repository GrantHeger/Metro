    <h1>Notice of Public Hearings</h1>
    <p>Thank you to everyone who participated in Metro's public hearings.</p>
    
	<p>EXTENDED COMMENT PERIOD: Comments or emails received no later than Friday, June 27 will also be considered.  Comments should be sent to NFTA, 181 Ellicott Street, Buffalo, NY 14203, Attn: Service Planning Department or emailed to planning@nfta.com.</p>
    
    
    <p>The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority is seeking public comment on a proposal to adjust Metro bus service on Route 27 Wende and Route 57 Tonawandas. <br/><br/>
    In order to develop a more efficient transit network, Metro regularly monitors service performance. The annual service review includes objective information on route ridership and
    productivity. This provides a foundation for developing service adjustments to best meet the needs within the framework of NFTA Metro’s adopted Service Guidelines and available funding. 
    The annual service review identified several routes that did not meet expected goals. In response, the NFTA is proposing the following adjustments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Replace existing Route 57 Tonawandas with Fixed Route Flex Pilot Service</li>
        <li>Discontinue Route 27 Wende</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Two public hearings are scheduled as follows:</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/img/MapFlex57.jpg" width="650" height="1093" alt="Proposed Flex Route" /></p>
    	
    <p>The proposed flex route provides the reliability of a fixed route schedule with the convenience of curb-to-curb service, for paratransit eligible riders, to requested deviations within a 3/4 mile zone of the route. Deviation requests must be scheduled in advance via phone and are limited to one deviation per trip to maintain the fixed route schedule. The proposed flex route also provides an additional transit option for customers making paratransit trips within the 3/4 mile zone. </p>
