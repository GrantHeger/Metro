    <div id="main">
        <p>Metro's Route 57 Tonawandas has been redesigned to better serve your community. Popular locations like Tops and the Mid-City Plaza remain, with several new locations added. Route 57 is still a regular “fixed” route, open to everyone. The big difference? It's now Flexible.</p>
	
	<p>Route 57 Tonawandas Flex now also offers curb-to-curb service for Paratransit customers. Paratransit customers can request a pick-up or drop-off by a Route 57 bus. Requests must be placed at least 24 in advance, be within three-quarters of a mile of the fixed route, and only one Flex trip (origin and destination) per trip will be accepted.   </p>
	<p>Requests for Curb-to-curb Route Flex service can be made to 855-6399 starting Saturday, August 30 for service commencing Tuesday, September 2. </p>
