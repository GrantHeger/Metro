	<h5>Single Tracking </h5>
	
	<p> Monday, July 21:  Metro Rail will single track on the outbound side (eastern side) .  The newly constructed station on the outbound track at Fountain Plaza will be utilized for the first time. Metro Rail will use the outbound track between Allen Medical Station and Church St. Stations. All passengers will need to change trains at Church St.</p>
	
    	<a href="http://metro.nfta.com/routes/Route.aspx?rt=45">Schedule Information</a>
    	
    	<h5>Inbound and Outbound</h5>
    	
    	<p>The Metro Rail system has two tracks, an INBOUND track, on the western side of Main St. and an OUTBOUND track on the eastern side of Main.  When single tracking, only one of these tracks will be used.  Again, between Allen Medical and Church St. Stations.</p>
    	
    	<h5>Ramp use for mobility devices</h5>
    	<p>When Metro is single tracking on the INBOUND track</p>
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Inbound from University Station through Allen Medical Station, passengers with a mobility device must board the first car if they intend to exit at any of the aboveground stations.</li>
    	    <li>Inbound from Church Street or Seneca Street Stations, passengers with a mobility device must board the last car.</li>
    	    <li>Outbound from Erie Canal Harbor or Seneca Street Stations, passengers using a mobility device must board the first car.</li>
    	    <li>Outbound customers boarding at Church Street, Lafayette or Fountain Plaza Stations using a mobility device must board the last car. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When Metro is single tracking on the OUTBOUND track</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Inbound from University Station, passengers with a mobility device must board the last car if they intend to exit at any of the aboveground stations.</li>
            <li>Inbound from Church Street or Seneca Street Stations, passengers with a mobility device must board the first car.</li>
            <li>Outbound from Erie Canal Harbor or Seneca Street Stations, passengers using a mobility device must board the last car.</li>
            <li>Outbound customers boarding at Church Street, Lafayette or Fountain Plaza Stations using a mobility device must board the first car. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>Shuttle trains</h5>
        <p>Rail cars will run every 20 minutes between Church St. Station and the Erie Canal Harbor Station (or Events Only Station if open).  <!-- Shuttle trains will run on the track opposite of the track being used by the single tracking trains running to and from University Station.--> </p>
        
        <h5>Construction Schedule</h5>
        <p>Metro will begin single tracking on the INBOUND track this spring and switch this summer.  The schedule is dependent on the weather on construction progress.</p>
        
        <h5>Stay in touch</h5>
        <p>To keep you informed, Metro will post Rider Alerts throughout the system, online, and use the electronic message boards in each of the rail stations. Metro also uses Instant Updates.  <a href="http://alerts.nfta.com">Sign up</a> for text or e-mail messages on Metro Rail conditions and many other Metro related topics.</p>
        <h5>Why?</h5>
        <p>Metro rail is single tracking in order to maintain service during the revitalization of Main St.  We apologize for any inconvenience and will work hard to maintain the convenient, reliable service you have come to expect over the last 30 years. </p>
