    <strong>Paying Your Bus Fare</strong>

    <p>Boarding fare is $2. Passengers need to pay a boarding fare or present proof-of-fare each time they get on a bus or train.  Proof-of-fare can be a Metro Monthly Pass, 30 Day Pass, 7 Day Pass, or a Metro Day pass.</p>
    <p>Bus operators do not make change; you must have the exact fare when you board. Bus fareboxes accept U.S. coins, Metro tokens and paper currency only.</p>

    <strong>Finding a Bus Stop</strong>

    <img style="padding:0 10px 2px 0;" src="../img/stop.gif" width="100" height="171" alt="NFTA-Metro Bus Stop Sign" align="left" />
    <p>Every Metro bus stop has a three-colored sign. To find your closest bus stop, 
    check your schedule or the Trip Planner. Either one will tell you which streets your bus travels. Then 
    look for the bus stop signs along the bus route, located every few blocks. 
    When the bus approaches your stop, signal to the bus operator to stop.</p>

    <p>Some bus routes have on-demand bus stops. On these routes, simply signal the driver that you would like to be picked up. </p>

    <strong>Boarding the Bus</strong>

    <p>Look for your route number on the front or passenger side of the bus. If you are not sure it is the right bus, just ask the bus operator. </p>
    <p>Remember:<br />
    Priority seating in the front section of buses is reserved for disabled persons 
    and senior citizens. Drinking, eating, smoking and e-cigarettes are not allowed on any Metro 
    bus. Listening to an electronic device is allowed with headphones.  Service animals are the only animals allowed on Metro buses.</p>

    <strong>Riding the Bus</strong>

    <p>Take a seat if one is available. If all the seats are full, move towards the back of the bus. Poles and handrails throughout the bus make it easy to stand while riding. The seats at the front of the bus should be given to senior citizens and disabled riders, if present. </p>


    <strong>Signaling Your Stop</strong>

    <p>As the bus nears your stop, pull the cord or push the strip next to the windows. A bell will signal the bus operator that you would like the bus to stop. </p>
